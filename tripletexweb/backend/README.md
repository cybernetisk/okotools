# okoreports backend

This provides a backend api for the okoreports project. Its main
purpose is to fetch new data from external services that is used
in the reports that is generated by the frontend application.

## Development

Create the file `.env` and ensure it holds the correct configuration:

```text
TRIPLETEX_CONTEXT_ID=xxx
TRIPLETEX_CUSTOMER_TOKEN=xxx
TRIPLETEX_EMPLOYEE_TOKEN=xxx

# the following is optional

# this is the link to a Google Spreadsheet feed - the document must be published for this to work
# e.g. https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/worksheets/1pAEq8O5NMkmEWvW-c6x_47abg5IO7HqPO5bs5J-iPt4/public/full?alt=json
# set to None to disable budget
OKOREPORTS_BUDGET_URL=xxx

# the URL the user can go to and edit the spreadsheet
OKOREPORTS_BUDGET_EDIT_URL=xxx
```

Make sure you have Python 3.10 or newer.

```bash
cd okotools
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

```
